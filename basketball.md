Basketball
==========

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is backing a $1B prize to 
anyone who can predict the winners of all 63 "March Madness"
basketball games.

Corey Chivers on the "Bayesian Biologist" blog did a few simple probability
calculations and decided Buffett's money was [pretty safe](http://bayesianbiologist.com/2014/01/22/whats-warren-buffetts-1-billion-basketball-bet-worth/).

Code
====

The code to produce the calculations and figures in the blog post
were made available via [Github's](http://www.github.com) system
of ["Gists"](https://gist.github.com/), a place to post short files
for public consumption.

The URL for Corey Chivers' code is:

In the top right of the code box is a "<>" link which gets the raw
file. Hit that, and save the resulting file. Call it `basketball.R`.
